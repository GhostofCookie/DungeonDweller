- you may want to think about who is responsible for creating/loading the
  RoomTree (is it the constructor itself?  Or is it some other class?)

  Also, is your map really a tree or is it more like a graph?  And is there
  such a thing as "root" if it is not a tree?

- For item it seems like there is a "remainingUse" for weapon but not others.
  But the use function is defined in Item.  What would happen if you try to
  use something but there are no more uses?

- how does invisibility potion interact with the character?

- why would we care if a number is even or not in Screen?  And if you do care,
  why does that function belong in Screen?

- For the GameState classes, instead of Setting the layout, why not just have
  it display the layout?

- I am not really sure why you need builder class for Player (and maybe NPC).
  Is it not just reading some stats from a file (or hardcoded?)

Overall comments:

- there are some minor problems but I think you have given quite a bit
  of thoughts and it is a good start.  Certain parts may be
  overcomplicated (e.g. builders)
